  question: What's the difference between F-Droid and Google Play versions of tha app?
---

F-Droid version comes without [Google Play Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play_Services). These Services improve location accuracy using nearest cell towers and wifi hotspots if internet connection is available. F-Droid version uses only device GPS sensor.

With OrganicMaps from Google Play you can disable Google Play Services for location search in app settings.
