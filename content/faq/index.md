# Some places are missing on the map or have wrong names

Our map data source is OpenStreetMap (OSM). This is a mapping project similar to Wikipedia, but for maps, where anybody can create and edit maps.

If you see incorrect information, or if you find that some objects are missing on the map, you can leave a note for OSM editors or register and edit the map.

The more people contribute, the more detailed maps we get. We believe that the most detailed map of the whole world, created by the open community, is just a matter of time.

**Notes**:

- You can also add new places, edit existing POI and building info (addresses, opening hours, names) directly via Organic Maps. Once you log in with OSM account, your edits will be automatically uploaded to OSM. Please be careful when editing, as your edits will be visible to all other users.

- The OpenStreetMap database is updated every minute. We aim to update maps in the app 1-4 times per month. If you modified something in OSM, your edits will appear in future maps updates.

## The app can't find my position on the map

Please make sure your device has GPS and Location settings are activated.

**Android**:

On your device open Settings → Location. It is better to switch on High accuracy mode.

If you have difficulty determining your location with GPS, enable (disable, if enabled) "Google Play Services" in the app settings.

Note: you can see it only if you have Google Play services installed (enabled) on your Android device. Google play services are used to determine location more precisely, if you experience issues with location accuracy after you disabled the option, turn it on.

**iOS**:

If you are an iPhone or iPad user, please check iOS settings → Privacy → Location services. Geolocation data sharing should be enabled for Organic Maps.

**Notes**:

- To avoid unwanted data while roaming, you can turn off all mobile data, activate a flight mode or disable mobile data for Organic Maps in your device settings. Android and iOS devices can use GPS in the flight mode.

- Some mobile devices do not have built-in GPS receivers, such as the iPod Touch, WiFi-only iPad, Amazon Kindle Fire/Kindle Fire HD 7 and some Android tablets. On these devices our application will show your approximate location, as long as you are connected to the internet.

- Finally, please remember that location determining with GPS (with WiFi and Mobile Network off) may take some time. The longer the GPS has not been used, the more time it takes. The speed of location determining depends on the device, not on the app. The GPS' operation is influenced by the weather as well – it works best outdoors when the sky is clear. Problems may arise when trying to locate yourself indoors, on a narrow street or when driving a car.

## I can't download (update) maps

Your download can fail due to a temporary network error or specific network provider/router settings. Please try again later or use a different Wi-Fi access point. In addition, make sure, that you have enough free space to download maps.

On Android, please make sure that you have granted network access for Organic Maps and system Download Manager (Download Provider).

Also, if you have very outdated maps and the app can't update them, it may help to delete outdated maps and re-download them.

## Search cannot find a place on the map

Remember that to search for a place in a specific area, you will need to download a relevant map and zoom in the map to that area, or your location should be near that area before you begin search. For example, if you want to find a place in Vietnam and your location is somewhere else, you should download and open the map of Vietnam first.

In addition, the place may not have been added to the map yet at OpenStreetMap.org, our map data source. If you want to help and improve the map, check [this guide](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Contribute_map_data).

If the place is displayed on the map in Organic Maps, but our search cannot find it, report us coordinates of the place and an example of your search request.

## What can I do if the app has stopped/crashed

It's probably our bug, and we will be happy to fix it in the next update.

On Android, if you store your maps on an SD card, the most likely cause is a faulty SD card. You can format your SD card, or better yet replace it with a new one. If you moved the app itself to SD card, please move it back to the internal (device) storage.

If the issue continues, please [contact us](mailto:support@organicmaps.app) and give us:

- short description of the issue
- Organic Maps version
- device model and OS version (Android or iOS).

## How to create a route

Once your location is determined on the map, choose your destination. You can use one of the following ways:

- tap the search button
- tap the bookmarks button
- tap (tap and hold for empty areas) any place on the map

Once you have chosen point of destination, press "Route to" button in the place page. The route will be created and you will see distance and estimated travel time. You can change the route type by pressing the Car, Pedestrian, Subway, Bike or Taxi icon at the top of the screen. To start following the route tap "Start" button. Press the arrow sign in the lower right corner of the screen and tap Stop to finish the route.

Alternatively, to plan a route, you can press "Route" icon in the bottom menu panel. You can choose different starting point (Route from button) to preview a route, but navigation is only available from your current location.

You can add up to 3 intermediate points to a route. To add an intermediate point: create a route between start and destination → then tap a point on the map and tap "Add stop".

You can change the settings of the car route and select road types that you would like to avoid (tolls, unpaved roads, motorways, ferries). Open the app settings → Routing options → Toggle On needed options.

## I can't hear voice instructions

**Notes**: voice instruction are available for car and cycling routes. For now, you can hear voice instructions only while driving and when the screen is on.

If you can't hear voice instructions:

- Please make sure that your device's volume is not muted. You can change the volume level with your device's volume buttons. To do that, you may need to disable "Change with Buttons" option (if enabled) in the device settings → Sounds.

- When you turn on Bluetooth, it shouldn't reflect voice instructions. However, we didn't test voice guidance with car audio, it may cause the issues. In this case, you can turn Bluetooth off.

- If you are an Android user and the option is disabled (or some of the supported languages are unavailable), please check system TTS settings.

On Android voice instructions are available in 27 languages: English, Arabic, Chinese (Traditional and Simplified), Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Vietnamese.

Google TTS supports all listed languages except of Arabic and Persian (Farsi). For these languages you may need to install third party TTS (for example, eSpeak TTS, Vocalizer TTS or SVOX Classic TTS) and a language pack from app store (Google Play Store, Galaxy Store, etc).

On iOS voice instructions are available in 26 languages: English, Arabic, Chinese (Traditional and Simplified), Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish.

## How to share (export) bookmarks

Choose a bookmark on the map, tap it and then tap "Share" button in the place page. To share all bookmarks in a list at once, tap the double star symbol on the main screen, tap the icon with three dots in front of name of the list with bookmarks and tap Export file in the pop-up window.

## How to import bookmarks

You can import bookmarks sent from Organic Maps or third party apps if they export bookmarks in KML format:

- On Android, you can import bookmarks from folders and apps (including Maps.Me). Press a star button to open bookmarks, press "Import bookmarks" and select drive or folder with KML/KMZ files.

- Open shared KML/KMZ file with bookmarks sent by email, instant messenger or cloud storage, for example, iCloud or Google Drive.

- Tap once or tap and hold the KML/KMZ file with bookmarks and choose Open with Organic Maps (Android) or "Import with Organic Maps" (iOS) in the pop-up window.

- It will be open with Organic Maps and you'll see 'Bookmarks loaded successfully!'. You can find them on the map or in Bookmarks Menu screen.
