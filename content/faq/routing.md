### Why OrganicMaps builds crooked route?

This could happen if map data is outdated. We work on routing constantly. Please update the app regularly.

Sometimes near country or region borders route could be unoptimal. This is known issue.

### Why map rotates around my position?

The reason could be magnet on your phone case or radiation source near the phone. It could interfere compass sensor.

To improve compass use callibration moves according to [instruction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Uq7AmSAjt8).

### Location arrow points to wrong direction. How to fix?

Probably you have problem with compass sensor. See previous question for solution.

### Routing options are visible only when route can be modified by them. Otherwise they're hidden.
