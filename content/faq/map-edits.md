OrganicMaps works with map data from [OpenStreetMaps.org](https://osm.org) project. You can improve place details using "Edit Place" button. To make your changes publicly available you need an account on [OpenStreetMaps.org](https://osm.org). If you want to change POI position, or clarify footway, or add buildings and bridges, please use [OpenStreetMaps.org](https://osm.org) site with powerful editing tools.
